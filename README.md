- 👋 Hi, I’m @aadhi-imran-a, I'm from India, just got provisionally accepted into a reputed institution, hoping to go to college, grind, and eventually land up as a FAANG SDE. Sorry, MAANG SDE.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things coding. Used to be quite good when I was young, finished certificate courses in C,CPP and Java at the ages of 10,10 and 11 respectively. But got a little rusty now because of an 8 gap trying to get into a good college. Starting from scratch again.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python (and re-learning CPP)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me hone my skills, especially with other beginners, so I don't end up screwing someone's inportant project over.
- 📫 You can reach me on my email - aaadhiimran@gmail.com
